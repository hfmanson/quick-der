/*
 * Get a block of 8 bits, numbering from the beginning of the
 * BIT STRING.  This can be used to retrieve byte sequences in a
 * BIT STRING, as is often done for signatures and key material.
 *
 * Note that the last byte can give special treatment to the
 * last significant few bits, but only when the BIT STRING was
 * created for a number of bits that is not a multiple of 8.
 * Since Quick DER will silently overlook incoming BER habits,
 * it will not change such bits, regardless of their transport
 * format.  This should not invalidate any digital signatures,
 * since nobody will be signing BER anyway (DER and CER are used
 * for that, which is what this function basically delivers).
 *
 * The unchanged nature of the last byte, if it is partially
 * present in the data, is in the interest of future extensions.
 * To accommodate these, you should initialise the value
 * before calling this function, by setting it to the expected
 * default value.
 *
 * The return value is -1 for out-of-ranger errors, or zero on
 * success, in which case it has set the value in those bits
 * that were found in the BIT STRING data.  Only when value
 * is NULL, will it not be set and the return value can be used
 * to see if this operation would have been possible.

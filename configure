echo My apologies\; I have not enjoyed my previous encounter with autotools.
echo
echo For a package supposed to overcome platform differences, it had too many

echo structure of the autotools, making it seem like an endless series of
echo fixes without clarity of why any of them was needed, and where.
echo
echo Please accept my humble offering of Makefiles instead.
